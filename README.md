# CustomDoubleButtonRangeSlider
I wrote this custom range slider for xamarin.android because I couldn't find a rangeslider\seekbar that fit my needs. It not only allows the the developer to use one to 1 button on the same seek bar but the developer can chose to display 2 buttons. Buttons can be customized with a preferred image as well. There are a few bugs with this control but with a little effort you figure out how to get through those. It has a few bugs that I'll be fixing soon. Feel free to use as you'd like.

If you have any questions or need help, please feel free to contact me. I'll provide as much help as possbile.
